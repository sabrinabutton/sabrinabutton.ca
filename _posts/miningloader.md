# Project Overview

Created a line-follower navigation algorithm for a robot equipped with an Arduino Uno, SHARP infrared sensors, and DC motors. Designed and modelled a scoop and arm mechanism using Linkage, and expanded the program to perform tasks such as scooping, carrying, and dropping dirt on queues from the infrared sensors.
