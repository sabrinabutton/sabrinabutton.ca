This feeder is an intelligent, internet-connected system that ensures pets are fed consistently and safely‚Äîeven when owners are away. Below is an in-depth dive into our design, engineering trade-offs, and software logic.

## üìå Project Summary

**Objective:** Create a customizable, reliable, and safe automated feeder that adjusts to pet type and feeding schedules.
**Company Alias:** Petronix (fictitious for course purposes)
**Core Features:**

* Smart scheduling via a web interface
* Animal recognition using AI
* Dual-motor control for dispensing and bowl serving
* Airtight storage and secure bowl containment

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Mechanical Design

Our design separates the feeder into two mechanical subsystems: **Dispensing** and **Serving**.

### Mechanism & Actuator Choice

Each subsystem was sized based on torque and speed requirements. A **helical screw driven by a stepper motor** was used to dispense food. The **serving tray** is actuated via a servo motor and linear guide system.

- Dispensing: 42STH47-1684B Stepper ‚Äì High torque and speed, continuous rotation
- Serving: HS-422 Servo ‚Äì Limited rotation, precise position control


A gear-up stage was added for the servo to achieve the necessary range of motion.

## üì∑ Sensor Integration

We use a multi-sensor approach for robust functionality:

### Ultrasonic Sensor (HCSR04)

* Detects when a pet is in front of the feeder
* Mounted at the front of the hopper
* Fast 60ms cycle time and 4m range

### IR Sensor (GP2Y0A41SK0F)

* Monitors remaining kibble in hopper
* Mounted facing downward from the lid
* Interpolated distance based on manufacturer curves

### ArduCAM Mini

* Captures JPEG stills for pet identification
* Sends images to a Flask server via TCP
* Lightweight CNN processes images to identify dog, cat, or neither

### Load Cell (Abandoned)

Initially used for PID weight control. Abandoned due to dynamic error and sensitivity limitations. We switched to **time-based portioning** for consistency.

## üß† Software Architecture

### State Machine Overview

The core logic is a loop-driven **state machine**. Each loop iteration does the following:

1. Updates the UI and variables
2. Checks the kibble level
3. Executes a specific state action (e.g. "FILLING BOWL")

If an error is detected, the system returns to the `IDLE` state for safety.

### State Action Logic

Each state handles specific logic. Here's a breakdown of which actions are triggered in each state:

### Web UI Features

The lightweight web interface is hosted on the Arduino itself. It supports:

* Reading system variables (hopper fullness, time to next meal, bowl status)
* Setting feeding parameters
* Activating "override mode" (manual control)
* EEPROM saving/loading of settings
* Calibration of the hopper‚Äôs empty state

## üéØ System Objectives

### Variable Control

System variables are adjustable from the web UI and saved in EEPROM to persist through reboots. This ensures pets receive the correct schedule regardless of power state.

### Portion Control

We use a **time-based method** for feeding: a calibrated 3-second auger run equals one serving. This avoids reliance on the noisy load cell while ensuring consistent portions.

### Web Override Mode

An override mode allows users to remotely control the bowl and auger, halting the automatic loop. This is useful for maintenance or emergency feeding.

### Secure Bowl Containment

The bowl is mechanically hidden during the dispensing phase to prevent premature access. The bowl extends only when feeding is complete.

## üß† AI Pet Recognition via TCP

We implemented **AI-based pet detection** using a JPEG burst from ArduCAM sent to a laptop Flask server over TCP. A lightweight CNN classifies the image as:

* Dog
* Cat
* Neither

This result determines whether the bowl is extended and food is dispensed.

## üß© Key Takeaways

* A modular mechanical and software design makes the system adaptable and repairable
* Despite sensor limitations (notably the load cell), reliable performance was achieved via creative trade-offs
* Real-time web-based control and AI integration added both convenience and novelty
* Mechanical and software safety features ensure pet and device safety
