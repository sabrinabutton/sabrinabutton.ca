# Impact
This project showcases the potential of student-led innovation in autonomous maritime technology, contributing to environmental monitoring and research. By developing an Autonomous Surface Vehicle (ASV) equipped with advanced sensors and real-time telemetry, the Nautical Disaster enhances our ability to study and protect aquatic ecosystems. The project supports SDG 14 (Life Below Water) by promoting sustainable practices in marine environments. Additionally, it provides valuable hands-on experience for students in engineering, robotics, and environmental science, fostering the next generation of innovators dedicated to environmental stewardship.

# Project Overview 

In Fall 2023, I co-founded aQuatonomous—a student-led design team with a vision to reimagine how we explore, monitor, and protect our aquatic environments. What started as a spark of curiosity in autonomous systems and environmental stewardship has grown into a tight-knit team of passionate engineers, designers, and researchers, united by a common goal: building smarter, greener marine technology.

Our Mission: *To design and deploy autonomous maritime technology that supports sustainable research, fosters environmental awareness, and empowers students through hands-on innovation.*

In 2025 we built The Nautical Disaster, our flagship ASV. Named with a wink to its turbulent early testing days (and a reference to The Tragically Hip), the Nautical Disaster is an electric vessel equipped with real-time telemetry, water quality sensors, and a robust Pixhawk-based control system. It was engineered specifically for deployment on Lake Ontario, a body of water whose ecological complexity and environmental importance pose specific engineering challenges.

And in March 2025, our mission took us far from home—to Sarasota, Florida, for the RoboNation RoboBoat competition, where The Nautical Disaster was put to the test against some of the best autonomous vessels in the world. We were proud to make it to the semi-finals in 4 out of 5 autonomy tasks, and placed 4th overall in design presentation—out of 27 teams from 9 countries. The experience was a milestone for our team, and a powerful validation of what student-led innovation can accomplish.

Back at Queen's, we were honoured to win the Overall Award at the Queen’s Design Team Awards, recognizing our technical achievements, environmental focus, and team culture. From our founding team of three, aQuatonomous has grown to over 60 students, organized into 8 interdisciplinary subteams covering everything from mechanical design and embedded systems to autonomy and sustainability outreach.
