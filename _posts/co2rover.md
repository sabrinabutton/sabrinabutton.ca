# Project Overview

A four-wheeled autonomous rover was modded with the primary objective of generating a heat-map illustrating CO2 concentration levels across a LiDAR SLAM-generated floorplan. This rover was successfully demonstrated to an audience of over 50 students and professors.

The rover's sensor suite comprises a LiDAR unit, encoders, sharp infrared sensors, an SGP30 CO2 Sensor, an RPLiDAR, and a gyroscope and accelerometer IMU. Systems integrated to pursue the objective include joypad control, a PID Controller for precise motion, pre-packaged SLAM for environment mapping, and the implementation of a specialized algorithm to create CO2 concentration heat maps using sensor data, occupancy grids, and matplotlib visualization.
