# Project Overview

This project was undertaken to enhance the signal strength of an outdoor antenna. It involves an antenna affixed to a servo-motor-driven robotic arm, which assesses signal strength at specific angles and adjusts its orientation to optimize internet connectivity. The Arduino platform was utilized to program the servos and communication functions, interfacing with a computer through serial port communication, and featuring a C-based GUI.
